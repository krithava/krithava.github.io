    <h1>HTML</h1>
    
    <div id="introduction">
      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links. A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.</p>
      <p>HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos.</p>
      <p>It is composed of elements</p>
      <img src="./htmlelement.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="A diagram of html element showing that it is made up of a opening tap, the content and the closing tag."/>
    </div>

    <div id="elements">
      <h2><u>HTML Elements</u></h2>
      
      <h3><u>Body</u></h3>
      <p>The body tag defines the documents body. The content inside the body element is what is displayed to the screen. This is how a body element looks like:</p>
      <pre>
        < body > 
          "Content here"
        < /body >
      </pre>
      <p>Content such as images, text and buttons are added here.</p></p>

      <h3><u>Headings</u></h3>
      <p>Headings are used to describe content such as titling and sections. There are 6 differnet headings where h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest.</p>
      <p>This is an example of h1:</p>
      <pre>
        < h1 > Heading element H1 < /h1 >
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <h1>Heading element H1</h1>
      <p>This is an example of h6:</p>
      <pre>
        < h6 > Heading element H6 < /h6 >
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>          
      <h6>Heading element H6</h6>

      <h3><u>Divs</u></h3>
      <p>The div element is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections which is useful for grouping elemnts in HTML together and providing structure.</p>
      <p>They don't contribute anything visually to the site but is useful when providing custom styles (css) as you can style specific divs.</p>
      <p>Can also be used for navigation as you can choose to go to a specific part of the page using the div id.</p>
      <pre>
        < body >
          < div > 
            "Introduction"
          < /div >

          < div > 
            "Main"
          < /div >
            
          < div > 
            "End"
          < /div >
            
        < /body >
      </pre>   
          
      <h3><u>Attributes</u></h3>
      <p>Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element. Made up of two parts: name of the attribute and value of the attribute </p>
      <p>One example of an attribute is id which is used to specify differnet contents such as divs. So the updated div would look like this: </p>
      <pre>
        < body >
          < div id="intro"> 
            "Introduction"
          < /div >

          < div id="main"> 
            "Main"
          < /div >
            
          < div id="end"> 
            "End"
          < /div >
            
        < /body >
          
      </pre>   
      <h3><u>Display Text</u></h3>     
      <p>To display text in HTML, you can use paragraph or span.</p>
      <p>Paragraphs (< p >) contain a block of plain text.</p>
      <p> < span > contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.</p>
      <pre>
        < p > Test paragraph with the word < span > key < /span > targeted.< /p >  
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <p>Test paragraph with the word <span>key</span> targeted.</p>   
          
      <h3><u>Styling Text</u></h3>     
      <p>To style texts using html tags, you can use the em tag or strong tag</p>
      <p>The < em > tag is used to emphasis text and will render the text as <em>italic</em>. </p>
      <p>The < strong > tag is used to highlight important text and will render the text as <strong>bold</strong>. </p>
      <p>The following example will show you how to use these tags:</p>
      <pre>
        < p > < strong > The Nile River < /strong > is the < em > longest< /em > river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).< /p >
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>

      <h3><u>Line Breaks</u></h3>     
      <p>To modify the spacing of content in the browser you will use the line break element < br > </p>
      <p>The line break element is unique as you will only need to use one starting tag.</p>
      <p>The following example will show you how to use a line break:</p>
      <pre>
        < p > This is a sentence. < br >How would I make it a new line? < br > You use line break.< /p >  
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <p>This is a sentence.<br>How would I make it a new line?<br>You use line break.</p>     

      <h3><u>Lists</u></h3> 
      <p>In addition to organising text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list. There are two types of lists: unordered and ordered.</p>
      <h4>Unordered Lists</h4>   
      <p>In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (< ul >) to create a list of items in no particular order. It outlines individual list items with a bullet point.</p>  
      <p>Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the < li > tag. The < li > or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.</p>
      <p>The following example will show you how to make an unordered list:</p>
      <pre>
        < ul >
          < li > Red < /li >
          < li > Blue < /li >
          < li > Green < /li >
        < /ul >        
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
        <li>Green</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Ordered Lists</h4>   
      <p>Ordered lists are like unordered lists but instead of bullet points it will be numbered.</p>  
      <p>Instead of ul tag you use ol tag (< ol >) and then the indiviual list items you use < li > tag.</p>
      <p>The following example will show you how to make an ordered list:</p>
      <pre>
        < ol >
          < li > First you get two slices of bread. < /li >
          < li > Then you get a cheese slice. < /li >
          < li > Finally you place the cheese inbetween the bread and you have a cheese sandwich! < /li >
        < /ol >        
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First you get two slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Then you get a cheese slice.</li>
        <li>Finally you place the cheese inbetween the bread and you have a cheese sandwich!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3><u>Images</u></h3>     
      <p>The < img > tag allows you to add an image to a web page. It is a self-closing tag.</p>
      <p>It has a required attribute called src which must be set to the source or the location of the image so the URL of the image.</p>
      <p>The following example will show you how to use to insert an image</p>
      <pre>
        < img src="html5icon.png" />
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <img src="html5icon.png" />
      <p>As you can see the image is very big so to make it smaller you can use the attibutes height and width. </p>
      <p>The alt attribute is used to bring meaning to the images. Its used to give a short description of the image.</p>
      <p>Its useful when the image fails to load on a web page as the user can mouse over the area and it will show the text description, also good for Search Engine Optimisation. </p>
      <p>The following example will show you the updated img tag </p>
      <pre>
        < img src="html5icon.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt= "The logo of HTML5" />
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <img src="html5icon.png" height="300" width="300" alt="The logo of HTML5"/>

      <h3><u>Videos</u></h3>     
      <p>The < video > tag allows you to display a video to a web page. Requires an opening and closing tag.</p>
      <p>It also has a required attribute called src which must be set to the source or the location of the video.</p>
      <p>There is also an attribute called controls which will instruct the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.</p>
      <p>The following example will show you how to use to insert an video</p>
      <pre>
        < video src="https://youtu.be/ok-plXXHlWw" width="320" height="240" controls>
          Video not supported
        < /video >
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ok-plXXHlWw">
