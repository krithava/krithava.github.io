      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links. A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.</p>
      <p>HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos.</p>
      <p>It is composed of elements</p>
      <img src="./htmlelement.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="A diagram of html element showing that it is made up of a opening tap, the content and the closing tag."/>
    </div>

    <div id="elements">
      <h2><u>HTML Elements</u></h2>
      
      <h3><u>Body</u></h3>
      <p>The body tag defines the documents body. The content inside the body element is what is displayed to the screen. This is how a body element looks like:</p>
      <pre>
        < body > 
          "Content here"
        < /body >
      </pre>
      <p>Content such as images, text and buttons are added here.</p></p>

      <h3><u>Headings</u></h3>
      <p>Headings are used to describe content such as titling and sections. There are 6 differnet headings where h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest.</p>
      <p>This is an example of h1:</p>
      <pre>
        < h1 > Heading element H1 < /h1 >
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>
      <h1>Heading element H1</h1>
      <p>This is an example of h6:</p>
      <pre>
        < h6 > Heading element H6 < /h6 >
      </pre>
      <p>which results in:</p>          
      <h6>Heading element H6</h6>

      <h3><u>Divs</u></h3>
      <p>The div element is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections which is useful for grouping elemnts in HTML together and providing structure.</p>
      <p>They don't contribute anything visually to the site but is useful when providing custom styles (css) as you can style specific divs.</p>
      <p>Can also be used for navigation as you can choose to go to a specific part of the page using the div id.</p>
      <pre>
        < body >
          < div > 
            "Introduction"
          < /div >

          < div > 
            "Main"
          < /div >
            
          < div > 
            "End"
          < /div >
            
        < /body >
      </pre>   
          
      <h3><u>Attributes</u></h3>
      <p>Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element. Made up of two parts: name of the attribute and value of the attribute </p>
      <p>One example of an attribute is id which is used to specify differnet contents such as divs. So the updated div would look like this: </p>
      <pre>
        < body >
          < div id="intro"> 
            "Introduction"
          < /div >

          < div id="main"> 
            "Main"
          < /div >
            
          < div id="end"> 
            "End"
          < /div >
            
        < /body >
      </pre>   

      <h3><u>Display Text</u></h3>     
      
    </div>
    <a href="/index.html">Click here to go back to home page.</a>
  </body>
    
</html>
